They were playing in the Superdome for the first time since—it was under construction and damage done, and they were just playing somewhere else. So it was a big deal for the city. And none of my family had tickets to the game. We just watched it at my house, which we didn't have any furniture yet. We had fold-out tables and fold-out chairs. We finally had a kitchen. The kitchen was finally set up. That's why we were having everyone over, 'cause we could do snacks and stuff. <span>(00:45)</span>And we were watching on this, like, in my mind, it's a crank TV, but I know it wasn't a crank TV, but it was like this tiny little TV for me and my extended family. Before the game, they had this performance that U2 and Green Day did because they did a song called \"The Saints Are Coming\" and you know, US and Green Day—It's very, like, <em>rah </em>. <span>(01:05)</span>But yeah, in that moment, I felt belonging because the city fell back, people were back, and it kind of felt like the <em>beginning </em>. I felt, you know, home again. It was—we had all the pieces of not feeling like belonging—people are separated and your home is not what it was.

I didn't want that to be the thing I shared, but I think I am reminded that that's the thing that I get a strong sense of belonging from because I'm reminded every day of those folks who make me feel the most like myself. <span>(01:30)</span>And it's dumb things like memes. But it's also big things like having someone text about recently what it was like to stop breastfeeding her child for the first time since she was born and weaning off and sharing that moment in the text and then the next day you get the best and worst memes of the internet. So I feel like my sense of belonging—I don't know why I feel it—but there are certain things that remind me of it and they can be really surface level like group chats or like just the comfort of, the deep comfort of being able to share space with someone.",

She's very small and sweet, kind of like the \"Golden Girls\" in a way.

But there was a second event in my year that happened at Ogie's—it was more relaxed, it was more casual. <span>(00:57)</span>And anyway, at one point in the evening, I was sort of sitting at this long table with everybody and I looked around and I saw a lot of faces. And for the first moment, in a long time, I realized I was with my brothers and sisters, people who I had been waiting to meet my whole life, people who in some way, I feel like I was destined to meet, people who are now very important parts of my life and my existence. And in that one moment of quiet calm, of just sort of looking around the table and seeing people talking and getting to know each other, seeing partners and spouses, people who are leaving the department, people who are coming in, people who had been there going into their thesis year and just looking and seeing all of these faces that I didn't know but that I had known all along. <span>(1:51)</span>And it was in that moment that I felt like I was part of something again. After a long period of not feeling like part of anything. Those moments are rare. I still cherish that when I think about my time here.",

Because for me, there's sort of a cycle when we pay attention. I can't help feeling like, <em>Oh, my goodness, I'm the most lucky person in the world </em> because when you to pay attention and realize you're surrounded by all these amazing beings—all bearing gifts—to me, attention leads to \"gift thinking,\" to thinking about the world as not something that we own or possess or deserve or work for, but as a gift. That <em>gift understanding. </em> That's what leads us to gratitude and then leads us to reciprocity, which leads us to deeply felt and deeply lived kinning. That cycle of attention, gift, gratitude, kinning. <span>(00:54)</span>When you're kinning in reciprocity, what are you doing? You're paying more attention, which cycles you right back. So it’s this beautiful, powerful motive force of gift, gratitude, and reciprocity, driven by attention.<span>(01:08)</span>One of the practices of attending that I think helps us feel a sense of belonging in the natural world is the same process that makes us feel like we belong in social situations. I have a four-year-old grandson who just began pre-K and he says, “Well, I don’t know anybody there.” So we chatted about the importance of learning the names of the kids that you’re sitting around the table with. And once you learn names, you say, \"You matter to me; we’re going to be in relationship.\" I need to know how to speak of you, how to address you.<span>(01:42)</span>I think that is the same practice of kinning that we can bring into the world. To deepen our own kinning is to learn names. I mean, it’s not just that I’m a botanist, and think we’re all going to go off and learn all those plant names, which is just a delight. You don’t have to have official names for plants and insects and rivers. What it takes is attention to get to know them well enough that you could call them by whatever name you come up with, but you know them well enough to call them by name. So just like my little sweet grandson learned to say, “Oh, what’s going to make me feel like I belong is learning names.” That’s a powerful gateway to kinship between us and our more-than-human kin as well.",

Firstly, just that we all share a common humanity and we all experience the hardness of life and the beauty and the curiosity of it all. So even just by the mere experience of us all being humans, we're connected to each other. This poem also kind of gives you the permission to just be who you are, like, be your nature, follow your desires and what's in your heart . . . <span>(01:22)</span>It's a funny day for me—a dear friend's husband—I just got word that he tried to take his life. They ended up finding him, and he's in the hospital right now. And I don't have the full context yet, but I think he's clearly having a lot of mental trouble. And I think that he made some pretty big mistakes hurting people, and from what I can gather, he probably wasn't able to cope with those choices. In the immediacy of receiving the news, and then right now, reflecting on your question—I don't know—I think there's also just this level of mercy that exists in the world that no matter what, you just want—I just want to hug him and hold him and love him no matter what he's done. <span>(02:11)</span>You know, I know there's radical mercy that exists. In my context, it's like from God, but also we all have access to that and to be that for other people. And things like this poem bring that to mind in a way, where everyone can be connected in hard times of despair. I just want to love him and I want him to know he's loved and he's beautiful and irreplaceable and he belongs. And I know I'm connected to him now even though I'm not with him and I know can send him my love.",

And now she's bought another house next door to that house as our family has started to grow, which is also filled with more objects and collectibles and things that I've never seen before that have been recently pulled out of storage. <span>(01:00)</span>And a few months ago, my one-year-old niece, my cousin's daughter, was visiting and we were all out at the family house, the one that I grew up going to, and everybody was busy cooking and so it was just me and my niece. I decided to take her on a walk down the beach together and sat on the lawn of the new family house that was still being prepared and construction was still finishing up. <span>(01:29)</span>And we sat down together and I just talked to her, not knowing if she could fully understand what I was saying and telling her about all of my memories at the house and just preparing her—sorry—preparing her for what it's going to be like growing up in her family and trying to just get her excited about everything that's to come and all of the memories that she's going to make on Whidbey Island, just like I did. And yeah, I think in that moment, I just felt really connected to my family and to her. And I can't even explain why, but it brought me so much happiness and a really strong sense of connection to something bigger than myself. And I felt for the first time like I was responsible for someone other than myself and helping them grow. And I'm so grateful that I have a picture of that moment as well.",

    "transcript": "<span>(00:00)</span>Basically, I got pregnant when I was, like, 23. So I was really young, and it wasn't like a planned pregnancy or anything like that. And it was really hard for me to accept the pregnancy throughout the whole thing. I literally just stayed home and, like, hid from people. I barely even told anyone I was pregnant. And then the day before my daughter was born, my dad passed, so that was really hard and after my daughter was born. I entered into this weird—not depression—I don't know what it was. I was just like, <em>I don't want to do anything. </em> But I had to because I had a child. I had to wake up early in the morning. I had to stay awake during the night to feed her. <span>(00:38)</span>So throughout the years, I noticed I kind of lost myself in a way. Generally, I've always been, like, a very playful person. My inner child was gone. I didn't want to play. I didn't want to have fun. Fun was gone for me. So until a year ago, because she's now one, I remember I hated having to play all the time. I didn't enjoy it. <span>(01:01)</span>So more or less a month ago, I was coming back home with my daughter, and it was raining, and she starts jumping in the puddles and wetting all her feet, her pants. All wet. And my initial reaction was like, <em>Oh, no, no, we have to go. We have to go. Let's not get wet.</em> But then I stayed there for a second, and I watched her, and I was like, <em>Oh, my God. I remember how fun this was when I was a kid. </em> And then I was like, <em>Wait, actually, no, we don't have to go. We can stay. </em> And I started jumping in the puddles with her, and she was laughing so much. And that's a time that makes me think of what it means to be connected. And I felt like my inner child was finally coming out again. Because I realized, <em>Oh, I didn't lose my inner child. Like, it's still there. I'm still me. </em> I just needed time. And now it's just so much better.",

But from the moment I moved here 8 years ago, the connections were </em> everywhere. <em>So-and-so grew up with my cousins, so-and-so is the brother of someone I went to elementary school with, so-and-so is my best childhood friend’s aunt. The large majority of these connections are through the ski community, where New Englanders flock to Utah to live or visit to ski. And working at the ski resort I ran into these people seemingly everyday—the people who’d see my last name on my name tag at work at the mountain and tell me they just saw my dad last week cause they brought their dog to the vet. Or the brother of my parents' carpenter friend who informed me my parents were building a porch (to which I told him they’d been saying that since 1990 and I didn’t believe him). <br><br> These intimate connections that touch my heart were everywhere in Utah, and it instantly felt like home, because my </em> homem <em>was still surrounding me. I could still feel the place and people I identify with and hold so close to my heart, in a place that looked a lot different, but made it easy to settle in and feel like I belonged here too. <br><br>To be thousands of miles away but still feel held and in proximity, whether it was only emotionally or otherwise, to the people and places I grew up with and love so dearly, was truly special to find where I did. </em>",

    "transcript": "<span>(00:00)</span>I thought about this for a while yesterday, and then this wonderful thing happened that made me really feel connected. And so I'll tell you what that thing was. I dropped a friend of mine off at the train station, and she and her little girl boarded a train to Connecticut. They noticed that there was a man—silver haired gentleman—who was smiling at them the entire time that they were waiting on the platform. And though this might be disgruntling to some, my friend Val, she's got a lot of angels protecting her, so she doesn't worry about those kinds of things. <span>(00:41)</span>And so they boarded the train, and Valerie and her little girl took their compartment. And the gentleman who had been smiling at them very grandfatherly passed them and said hello and smiled at them with these gorgeous eyes and kept on going a few compartments ahead and settled on a seat on the opposite side of them. <span>(01:04)</span>And a few minutes into the train ride, he came to them and said, \"I noticed you're a member of RIBS, Rhode Island Black Storytellers.\" And Valerie, of course, said, \"Yes, I am.\" And he said, \"Do you know a gentleman by the name of Rochelle Coleman?\" And she looked at the way he was smiling, and she said, \"As a matter of fact, he just dropped me off.\"  <span>(01:28)</span>And he began to tell her a story about a time that took place many years ago. We were both walking on Hope Street, and he was coming towards me, and I noticed that he was carrying this thing in his arm almost like a loaf of bread. And as we got closer and closer, I noticed that this was no loaf of bread. This was a baby. And the baby's head was in the palm of his hand. And the rest of the baby's body was straddling his forearm, almost like a waiter doing plate service, not carrying the plates on a tray, but just lined up on his arm, ready to deliver to a table. And the closer and closer these two got to me, the more I was just laughing, because this little baby was just enjoying this ride and giggling on this man's forearm, who had bright, smiling eyes and a shock of red hair. <span>(02:39)</span>Now, there was a car that was coming up behind him on Hope Street, and the car must have been as interested as I was in this scenario. And the windows rolled down, and these three boys—three young black boys—were watching this man carry this baby. And just as they passed him, three of the boys leaned out of the window and yelled, \"Man, you don't have caring no baby.\" And he looked at me, and I looked at him. It was a little shocking, and I just started laughing because this was a funny little moment. And the man looked at me and he said, \"I've carried all seven of my children in this way on these crisp fall evenings and to a tee, each one of them have enjoyed this.\" <em>Well how do you argue with a man who's carried seven children that way? How do you argue with a man who's raised seven children? And how could you even question what they loved? </em> <span>(03:52)</span>Well, I would say about five years later, I went into the John F. Kennedy School, not far from where we had talked that day, and he was the PTA President. We exchanged this memory of him carrying this baby like a loaf of bread or like a waiter doing arm service. And he showed me the little girl that was that little child that he'd been carrying. She had to be in about third or fourth grade at the time. And I've always remembered that. We've met several times since then, and we've always exchanged this memory. <span>(04:33)</span>And today on the train, talking to Val, he told her about this moment and the boys who had passed saying he didn't know what he was doing. Val thought that that was the funniest thing. And of course, she took a picture of him on the train and texted it to me. That man with the smiling eyes and shock of red hair, whose hair was now gray-white, but he still had those same smiling eyes. <span>(05:11)</span> And as soon as I saw his picture, even though his hair had changed, I knew exactly who he was. And I certainly remembered <em>instantly </em> that story of passing each other on Hope Street and the young boys telling him that he didn't know how to carry a baby. And instantly I started laughing. In the caption of his picture, he said that that little girl now had her own little girl. And it instantly made me understand my connection with Providence, with this community and the people that are in it.",

Reading sometimes helps suss that out. And it's usually with fiction or poetry. If I pick something up and the words or the language somehow creates a resonance with these ineffable feelings or thoughts, it's a very profound feeling of connection in that I don't feel so alone, that these very personal and very particular thoughts have been expressed or approximated by another person who published whatever it is I'm reading. <span>(00:54)</span>The first thing that comes to mind is Charlotte Bronte's <em>Villette </em>, which is one of my favorite books. And the main character, Lucy Snowe, the protagonist, is—she's not a cynic, she has a very hardened eye towards the world, and for that reason she's also very funny. But she has this quote. I'm gonna Google it because I don't know it exactly. It's like, \"Love is not a potato.\" <span>(01:21)</span>Oh wait here: \"No mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as being told to cultivate happiness. What does such advice mean? Happiness is not a potato to be planted and mulled and tilled with manure. Happiness is glory shining far down upon us out of heaven.\" Well, I don't know about that, but I do like that she opens with, \"No mockery in this world ever sounded to me so hollow as being told to cultivate happiness.\" <br><br>That's something that made me feel connected—I think these stories about these kind of hopeless, a little self-obsessed dreamers always resonates with me, and it helps to know that there have always been these sort of useless dreamers and writers throughout history.",

And I really felt struck by that poem because it related a lot to how I was feeling at the time. My boyfriend and I were going through a bit of a rough patch because we both just had been working so much and basically just getting used to not really being able to spend as much time together during the week as we had been used when I was in law school and when he was at his old job. <span>(00:32)</span>The poem just resonated with me and made me feel happy and content, and not really as sad about the situation as I had been feeling. It might sound a little bit weird, but it kind of just felt like a sign from the universe. I kind of just connected in that moment and just had this feeling that things were going to work out and going to be okay. <br><br>Seeing it kind of right when I needed to see it made me feel content and grounded.",

The soul is as much of a container of place as place is a container of soul.\"<br><br> <em>This is a quote by Robert Pogue Harrison. It makes sense of an experience I had, which changed my perception of home and belonging. I used to associate home with a particular place, my childhood home that I grew up in. A couple years ago my parents moved from California to Utah. I felt nostalgic when my parents sent photos of the California house packed up. Upon visiting their new home in Utah, I walked into the living room. The light was pouring in through big windows, and I immediately felt at home. It was then that I realized that home was not tied to a specific place for me, but to emotion and atmosphere. And that realization was freeing. </em>",

You know, with kind of the communal experience. To me, music is maybe the most important of all the arts. Just because it's sound. God is sound, you know. And there's all these different rhythms, crazy rhythms that are out there. Strange rhythms. <span>(00:23)</span>It can be electronic, it can be drums, whatever. So it's always been music. I mean, I love all of the arts, obviously, but fucking—I couldn't live without fucking music. You connect that with everything growing up, with friends, you know, identity about punk rock, different scenes and bebop—like throughout history, people have found their kind of tribe. <span>(00:43)</span>Grateful Dead is a great example. Me and my brother—that hit us. <br><br>I remember it really crystal clear. We're very young. I'm probably 21 with our good buddy and my brother. And we drive up and see the great Phil Lesch who was a bass player for the Grateful Dead. We're all too young, so we never saw Jerry. Jerry died. So we went up to this festival—and it's just seeing Phil playing all these tunes that we grew up to—fantastic \"Unbroken Chain\"—and just being there with my brother and our buddies and hanging out and camping and sleeping in a van and me buying beer. There was other stuff, obviously. It was a glorious weekend. Hanging out with older Heads I used to work with at one of my first college jobs who actually toured with the Dead, who was a Deadhead. Meeting him in the lot. <span>(01:29)</span>Like my uncle followed the Dead, my dad saw him in Missoula. The important thing to remember is there's concert—they had people—thank God, fucking God—people taped almost every show, predominantly. There's a lot of recorded stuff out there. So I couldn't listen to shows where my uncle was fifteen and my dad was like twenty, at some of their first shows because it's on tape. That's the preservation of art, which no one really thought of. They were like the first band to really—or the followers did it—and they tolerated it, kind of. And then there was a taper section. So you have all these shows—I can listen to shows that friends have been to, that older cats have been to. That's all preserved. And that's archival history right there.",

    "transcript": "<span>(00:00)</span>My longtime rowing partner and I were going out in Marina del Rey in a double skull for the first time since she was in recovery from cancer. The idea was we were going to see if we could get ourselves ready for the Head of the Charles Regatta, which is a three-mile race that takes place in Boston every year in October. Also, it's known as the largest Regatta in the world. Over ten thousand people participate over three days. Margie and I had rode in this event many times in the past and had won the race together and it was really our favorite event. <span>(00:42)</span>So we were going out for the first time, getting ready, and we had no idea what to expect because she was still recovering. We were quite familiar with each other in a boat, having rode together for more than 20 years and had been friends for a long time. Plus, both of us had been on the national rowing team, so we had techniques that were very similar. <span>(01:09)</span>So this could have been a row like any other. And normally when you get back in the boat after being away, it can feel unstable—a little rocky, a little rough. But this particular day was magic. Despite not being in the boat for over two years together and Margie still recovering her strength, you would have thought we had been practicing every single day. This outing was perhaps the most perfect rowing experience I've ever had in my 45 years in a sport. <span>(01:41)</span>We were completely in sync with one another, rowing like we were a single person. The boat was set up perfectly and we felt like we were absolutely flying. It was early in the morning, the sun had just come up, beautiful blue skies, and the water was like glass, so you could not have asked for better conditions. But unlike other times we had had in a boat, we barely said a word to one another until we reached the dock at the end of the outing about an hour later. <span>(02:14)</span>And in talking, we agreed. Number one: it was the best row we had ever had. We weren't sure exactly why. Maybe we were fooling ourselves because we hadn't been in the boat for a while and we were just so grateful to be there. But in the end, we decided that we must have been the greatest rowers ever in the history of the world and in the history of the sport, because that day was pure magic.",

Everything you have experienced is a lesson for me. And everything I have experienced is a lesson for you. <span>(00:35)</span>This is my favorite poem quote from Walt Whitman, excerpted from \"Song of Myself\":<br><br>I celebrate myself, and sing myself, <br><br>And what I assume you shall assume, <br><br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.",
